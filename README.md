## ðŸ›  Download git clone and exec

If you're setting up a **fresh macOS install** and **donâ€™t have Homebrew or Git** installed, follow these steps to get everything up and running:

**Run the following command** in your terminal to install Homebrew, Git, clone the repo and execute setup script:

**Default folder is ~/dotfiles/**

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/r18duarte/mac-dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
chmod +x ~/dotfiles/macsetup.sh
sudo /dotfiles/macsetup.sh
```

### What this command does

1. **Installs Homebrew** â€” macOS package manager

2. **Installs Git** â€” version control system (if itâ€™s not already installed)

3. **Clones this repo** â€” `dotfiles` into `~/dotfiles`

4. **Runs `macsetup.sh`** â€” Installs all the tools listed in the "Tools Installed" section
