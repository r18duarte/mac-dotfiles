## ðŸ›  Bootstrap (First-time Setup)

If you're setting up a **fresh macOS install** and **donâ€™t have Homebrew or Git** installed, follow these steps to get everything up and running:

**Run the following command** in your terminal to install Homebrew, Git, and clone the repo:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" && \
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && \
cd ~/dotfiles && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

```


### What this command does:

1. **Installs Homebrew** â€” macOS package manager
    
2. **Installs Git** â€” version control system (if itâ€™s not already installed)
    
3. **Clones this repo** â€” `dotfiles` into `~/.dotfiles`
    
4. **Runs `setup.sh`** â€” Installs all the tools listed in the "Tools Installed" section


## ðŸ’» Full Download (Clone & Execute)

If you already have **Homebrew** and **Git** installed on your Mac, or after youâ€™ve run the bootstrap command, you can directly clone this repo and execute the setup:

1. **Clone the repo:**
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
